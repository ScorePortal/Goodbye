          Scoreportal has been a long journey for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the small idea to empower students with data, we envisioned a
          platform that prioritizes the student's experience and aids them
          through the difficult challenges faced in a rigorous academic
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          We learned a lot on our journey from both you, our users, and from
          providing a better education experience for both students and teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have come far from where we started, but just like how not
          every seed can become a tree, not every startup grows to a successful
          company. This unfortunately means we must bring ScorePortal to a close.
        </p>
        <p>
          The product we envisioned to deliver is no longer sustainable
          due to the difficulty in scaling our team to the work we faced,
          licensing and legal issues, the running financial cost of development
          and maintenance, as well as the team now pursuing other areas in their
          respective universities. We decided it would be for the best to
          decommission ScorePortal.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to thank those who have been with us since the very beginning
          and those who have supported and motivated us continually throughout
          the years. From alpha-testers to beta-testers to our latest users, we
          thank you for everything you've given us.
        </p>
